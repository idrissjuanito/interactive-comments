# interactive-comments
This is my solution to a frontend Mentor challenge on creating and interactive comments section with html, css and javascript.

I chose to do it with vanilla javascript and and sass cuz am currently learning those. I am still a javascript beginner so my code structure may not be the best but will be hoping on your feedback and suggestions to help improve it.
